Work on fuzzy logic for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. FisPro Fuzzy
For this paper on fuzzy logic and its implementation we take a case of heating and cooling of two rooms, one above the other,
and model the temperature movement to generate rules that allow us to  generate the difficult situations in which fuzzy logic shines.
